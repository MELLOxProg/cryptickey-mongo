## Deploying with Vercel

Vercel is a great platform for deploying modern web applications like CrypticKey. This guide will walk you through the process.

### Prerequisites

- A Vercel account (you can sign up for free)
- Your CrypticKey project pushed to a GitHub repository

### Step 1: Import Your Project

1.  Log in to your Vercel dashboard.
2.  Click the "Add New..." button and select "Project".
3.  Import your CrypticKey GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Configure Your Project

Vercel will automatically detect that you are using Vite and will set the build and output settings accordingly.

- **Framework Preset:** Vite
- **Build Command:** `vite build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

To connect to your MongoDB database, you need to set up environment variables in Vercel.

1.  In your project settings, go to the "Environment Variables" tab.
2.  Add the following variables:

    -   `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas).
    -   `PORT`: The port your backend server will run on (Vercel will handle this automatically, but it's good practice to set it to 3000).

### Step 4: Configure Serverless Functions

To deploy your Express backend, you need to tell Vercel how to handle the API routes.

Create a `vercel.json` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "./backend/server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "./package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/backend/server.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Deploy

Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will build your project and deploy it.

### Step 6: Access Your Deployed App

Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL where you can access your live application.

### Troubleshooting

-   **502 Bad Gateway Error:** This usually means your serverless function is not running correctly. Check the function logs in the Vercel dashboard.
-   **Database Connection Issues:** Double-check your `MONGODB_URI` environment variable. Make sure your MongoDB instance allows connections from Vercel's IP addresses.
-   **Frontend Not Loading:** Check the build logs to ensure the frontend built correctly. Make sure your `vercel.json` routes are pointing to the correct output directory.
