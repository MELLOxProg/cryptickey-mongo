## Security Features and Considerations

CrypticKey incorporates several security features to protect your password data. It's important to understand both what protections are in place and what limitations exist.

### Current Security Features

#### Password Masking
- **Hidden Display:** Passwords are displayed as asterisks (***) in the passwords table.
- **Toggle Visibility:** The eye icon allows you to temporarily reveal passwords when needed.
- **Form Protection:** Password fields in the form are hidden by default.

#### Secure Data Transmission
- **HTTPS Ready:** The application supports HTTPS in production deployments.
- **JSON API:** All data is transmitted as structured JSON over HTTP/HTTPS.

#### Database Security
- **MongoDB Storage:** Passwords are stored in a dedicated MongoDB database.
- **Connection String Protection:** Database credentials can be secured via environment variables.

### Security Limitations

<Warning>
**Important Security Notice:** CrypticKey is designed for personal use and development environments. It currently has several security limitations that make it unsuitable for production use without additional security measures.
</Warning>

#### No Authentication
- **Open Access:** The application has no user authentication system.
- **Public API:** All API endpoints are publicly accessible.
- **Risk:** Anyone with access to your deployment can view and modify passwords.

#### No Encryption at Rest
- **Plain Text Storage:** Passwords are stored as plain text in the MongoDB database.
- **Database Access:** Anyone with database access can read all passwords directly.

#### No Rate Limiting
- **Unlimited Requests:** There are no limits on API request frequency.
- **Vulnerability:** The application could be subject to brute force or DoS attacks.

### Recommended Security Enhancements

If you plan to use CrypticKey in a production environment, consider implementing these security measures:

#### Authentication and Authorization
```javascript
// Example: Add JWT authentication middleware
const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  
  if (!token) {
    return res.sendStatus(401);
  }
  
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};
```

#### Password Encryption
```javascript
// Example: Encrypt passwords before storage
const crypto = require('crypto');

const encryptPassword = (password, secretKey) => {
  const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes192', secretKey);
  let encrypted = cipher.update(password, 'utf8', 'hex');
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
  return encrypted;
};
```

#### Environment Security
- **Secure Environment Variables:** Use services like Vercel's environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Database Security:** Enable MongoDB authentication and use secure connection strings.
- **HTTPS Only:** Force HTTPS in production environments.

### Best Practices for Secure Usage

#### Deployment Security
1. **Private Networks:** Deploy on private networks when possible.
2. **Firewall Rules:** Restrict access to known IP addresses.
3. **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies up to date.

#### Data Management
1. **Regular Backups:** Back up your password database regularly.
2. **Strong Master Passwords:** Use strong passwords for your database and hosting accounts.
3. **Access Control:** Limit who has access to your deployment and database.

#### Personal Security
1. **Secure Devices:** Only access CrypticKey from trusted, secure devices.
2. **Private Networks:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for password management.
3. **Regular Audits:** Periodically review and update your stored passwords.

### Security Roadmap

Future versions of CrypticKey may include:

- **User Authentication:** Login system with secure user management.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Client-side encryption before data transmission.
- **Rate Limiting:** API request throttling and abuse prevention.
- **Audit Logging:** Tracking of all password access and modifications.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Additional security layer for user accounts.

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in CrypticKey, please:

1. **Don't Post Publicly:** Avoid posting security issues on public forums.
2. **Contact Directly:** Email security concerns to [snoopynirav@gmail.com](mailto:snoopynirav@gmail.com).
3. **Provide Details:** Include steps to reproduce the issue and potential impact.
