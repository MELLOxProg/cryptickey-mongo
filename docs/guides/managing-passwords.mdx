## Managing Your Passwords

Once you have passwords saved in CrypticKey, you can easily manage them through the main interface.

### The Passwords Table

All your saved passwords are listed in a table at the bottom of the page. Each row represents a single password entry and provides several actions.

### Editing a Password

If you need to update a password, username, or website URL, follow these steps:

1. **Find the Entry:** Locate the password entry you want to edit in the table.
2. **Click the Edit Icon:** Click the pencil icon in the **Actions** column.
3. **Form Population:** The details of that entry will be loaded into the form at the top of the page.
4. **Make Your Changes:** Modify the fields in the form as needed.
5. **Save Your Changes:** Click the **Save Password** button to update the entry.

<Note>
**Note:** When you edit a password, the original entry is removed and a new one is created with your updated information.
</Note>

### Deleting a Password

To permanently remove a password from your database:

1. **Find the Entry:** Locate the password entry you wish to delete.
2. **Click the Delete Icon:** Click the trash can icon in the **Actions** column.
3. **Confirmation:** A browser confirmation prompt will appear, asking, "Do you really wish to delete this password?"
4. **Confirm:** Click **OK** to proceed with the deletion.

<Warning>
**Warning:** Deleting a password is a permanent action and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### Copying Information to Clipboard

CrypticKey makes it easy to quickly copy your credentials for logging into websites.

- **Copy Website URL:** Click the copy icon next to the site URL.
- **Copy Username:** Click the copy icon next to your username.
- **Copy Password:** Click the copy icon next to the hidden password (this copies the actual password, not the asterisks).

When you click a copy icon, you will receive a notification that the text has been copied to your clipboard.

### Viewing Passwords

For security reasons, passwords are not displayed directly in the table. To view a password, you can:

1. **Edit the entry** (as described above) to see the password in the form.
2. **Click the show/hide eye icon** in the password form to reveal the password.

### Best Practices for Management

#### Regular Audits
- Periodically review your saved passwords.
- Delete any entries for services you no longer use.
- Update any weak or old passwords.

#### Avoid Reusing Passwords
- When you edit a password, make sure you're not just reusing another password from your list.

#### Be Careful with Deletion
- Double-check that you're deleting the correct entry before confirming.
