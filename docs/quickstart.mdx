## Quick Start

This guide will help you get CrypticKey running on your local machine in under 5 minutes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (version 4.4 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MELLOxProg/cryptickey-mongo.git
cd cryptickey-mongo
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Install the backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running on your system. If you have MongoDB installed locally, start it with:

```bash
# On Windows
net start MongoDB

# On macOS/Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
touch .env
```

Add the following configuration to your `.env` file:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
PORT=3000
```

### Step 5: Start the Application

Open two terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 - Start the backend server:**
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

**Terminal 2 - Start the frontend development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:3000`

## What's Next?

Now that you have CrypticKey running, you can:

1. **Add your first password** - Click the save button after filling out the form
2. **Explore the interface** - Try copying passwords to clipboard and editing entries
3. **Check the API** - Test the endpoints using tools like Postman or curl
4. **Deploy to production** - Follow our [deployment guide](/deployment/vercel) to deploy on Vercel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MongoDB Connection Error:**
- Ensure MongoDB is running on your system
- Check that the connection string in your `.env` file is correct

**Port Already in Use:**
- Change the port in your backend `.env` file
- Kill any existing processes using the ports (3000 for backend, 5173 for frontend)

**Dependencies Not Installing:**
- Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again
