## Technical Architecture

This document provides an overview of the CrypticKey project's architecture, including the frontend, backend, and database components.

### High-Level Overview

CrypticKey follows a modern client-server architecture:

- **Frontend:** A single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.
- **Backend:** A Node.js and Express REST API server.
- **Database:** A MongoDB database for data persistence.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user experience.

#### Key Technologies
- **React:** For building the user interface components.
- **Vite:** As the build tool and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
- **React Router:** For client-side routing (not currently implemented).

#### Component Structure

The `src/components` directory contains the main React components:

- **`App.jsx`:** The root component of the application.
- **`Navbar.jsx`:** The navigation bar at the top of the page.
- **`Manager.jsx`:** The main component that handles the password form and table.
- **`Footer.jsx`:** The footer at the bottom of the page.

#### Data Flow

1.  **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the UI (e.g., filling out the form, clicking buttons).
2.  **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks manage the application's state.
3.  **API Calls:** The `fetch` API is used to communicate with the backend API.
4.  **UI Updates:** The UI is re-rendered based on state changes and API responses.

### Backend Architecture

The backend provides the API for the frontend to interact with the database.

#### Key Technologies
- **Node.js:** As the JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express:** As the web framework for building the REST API.
- **MongoDB Node.js Driver:** For interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **dotenv:** For managing environment variables.

#### API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following REST API endpoints:

-   `GET /api/passwords`: Retrieves all passwords.
-   `POST /api/passwords`: Saves a new password.
-   `DELETE /api/passwords`: Deletes a password.

#### Server Structure

The `backend` directory contains the server-side code:

-   **`server.js`:** The main entry point for the backend server.
-   **`.env`:** The environment variables file.
-   **`package.json`:** The backend dependencies.

### Database Architecture

The database stores all the password data.

#### Key Technologies
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL, document-oriented database.
- **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js (not currently used).

#### Data Schema

The `passwords` collection has the following schema:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId(...) (auto-generated)",
  "id": "string (uuid)",
  "site": "string",
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```
