## CrypticKey API

The CrypticKey API provides a RESTful interface for managing passwords programmatically. All endpoints return JSON responses and use standard HTTP status codes.

### Base URL

For local development:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

For production (Vercel deployment):
```
https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api
```

### Authentication

Currently, CrypticKey does not implement authentication. All endpoints are publicly accessible. **Important:** This is suitable for personal use or development environments only. For production use, implement proper authentication mechanisms.

### Content Type

All requests that send data must include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

### Response Format

All API responses follow this general structure:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],  // or single object
  "result": {...} // MongoDB operation result (for POST/DELETE)
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": "Detailed error information",
  "stack": "Error stack trace (development only)"
}
```

### Status Codes

- `200 OK` - Request successful
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request data
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `405 Method Not Allowed` - HTTP method not supported
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

### Rate Limiting

Currently, there are no rate limits implemented. However, it's recommended to implement rate limiting in production environments.

## Available Endpoints
